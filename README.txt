Hi, this is Siqi Fei, Joyce Ang, Kera Savian Venkateshwaran, and Japsirat Kaur Wadhwa.

The files we submitted on MarkUs represent only a portion of our final work and are intended to demonstrate that we completed the project independently.
However, we also have many other files related to data exploration, model selection and comparison, hyperparameter tuning, final model testing, and more. Please refer to our full GitHub repository:
